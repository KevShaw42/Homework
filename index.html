<h1>The One They Call <a href=https://github.com/KevShaw42>Kev</a></h1>
<h2>Love It</h2>
	<p>Ive always loved learning new cultures. I have spent a lot of time in Indiana, most of my life actually.  Being around the same monotonous culture fuels my love for the idea of foriegn traditions. The latin culture and deaf culture are two of my favorites.</p>
<h2>Hate It</h2>
	<p>I have never liked fruit.  At least, im very very picky about my selection.  It looks good, smells good, but when I actually eat it, I cant stand it. </p>
<h4>Havent Tried It</h4>
	<p>I've never had the opportunity to leave the country.  I would love the chance to get out of the United States and build on my love for new cultures.  I think Asia would be the ideal vacation because there are so many countries, cultures, food, religions that I could be exposed to.</p>
